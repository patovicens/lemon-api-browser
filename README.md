## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats & Important Notes

### Platform-Specific Considerations

#### iOS
- **Minimum iOS Version**: iOS 12.0+
- **Camera Permissions**: Requires camera access for QR scanning
- **Google Sign-In**: Needs proper URL scheme configuration in Info.plist
- **Splash Screen**: Custom launch screen with lemon icon and dark theme

#### Android
- **Minimum SDK**: API level 24 (Android 7.0)
- **Target SDK**: API level 36 (Android 14)
- **Permissions**: Camera and storage permissions required
- **Navigation Bar**: Custom themed navigation bar matching app theme
- **Splash Screen**: Custom launch screen with vector lemon icon

### API Limitations

- **CoinGecko API**: Free tier has rate limits (50 calls/minute)
- **Rate Limiting**: App includes rate limit handling and user feedback
- **API Key**: Demo API key included, but production should use registered key
- **Environment Setup**: API configuration is managed via `.env` file (see Setup Instructions)

### Performance Considerations

- **Hermes Engine**: Enabled by default for better performance
- **Image Optimization**: Uses vector icons where possible
- **List Rendering**: FlashList for large data sets
- **Background Processing**: Worklets for heavy computations

### Development Notes

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, avoid `any` types
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error context for consistent error handling
- **Theme System**: Dynamic theme switching with context

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Critical iOS Camera Fix (React Native 0.80+ with New Architecture)

If you're experiencing a **blank/white screen** when using the camera on iOS with React Native 0.80+ and New Architecture enabled, this is a known issue with `react-native-camera-kit` and the new Fabric renderer.

#### The Problem
- Camera preview shows as blank/white screen on iOS
- Not a permissions issue - camera permissions work correctly
- Caused by missing layout constraints in the new Fabric architecture
- Affects `react-native-camera-kit` version 15.1.0 and below

#### The Solution
This project automatically applies the necessary fix using **patch-package**. The fix is applied automatically when you run `yarn install`.

**What the fix does:**
- Adds Auto Layout constraints for Fabric 0.80.0 compatibility
- Replaces frame-based layout with constraint-based layout
- Ensures camera preview, scanner interface, and focus interface are properly positioned

**How it works:**
1. The fix is stored in `patches/react-native-camera-kit+15.1.0.patch`
2. When you run `yarn install`, patch-package automatically applies the fix
3. No manual file editing required
4. The fix persists across dependency reinstalls

**If you need to manually apply the fix elsewhere:**
The patch modifies `CameraView.swift` to add a helper function and update the view initialization method. You can view the exact changes in the patch file.

**Rebuild after installation:**
```bash
cd ios && pod install
yarn ios
```

#### Why This Fix Works
The new Fabric architecture requires explicit Auto Layout constraints. Without them, UIKit reports "ambiguous layout" causing views to be present but never rendered (hence the blank screen).

#### Official Fix Status
**Good news!** This issue has been officially fixed in [PR #731](https://github.com/teslamotors/react-native-camera-kit/pull/731) and is awaiting merge. The PR introduces the exact same solution we've implemented:

- Adds Auto Layout constraints for Fabric 0.80.0 compatibility
- Replaces frame-based layout with constraint-based layout
- Ensures proper view rendering under the new architecture

**Current status**: The PR has been approved by multiple reviewers and is ready for merge. Once merged, you can:
1. Remove the patch file: `rm patches/react-native-camera-kit+15.1.0.patch`
2. Update to the latest version: `yarn upgrade react-native-camera-kit`

#### Alternative Solutions
- **Wait for official fix**: The fix is ready and should be merged soon
- **Disable New Architecture**: Set `RCTNewArchEnabled` to `false` in `Info.plist` (temporary workaround)

### Common Issues

1. **Metro Bundler Issues**
   ```bash
   yarn start --reset-cache
   ```

2. **iOS Build Issues**
   ```bash
   cd ios && pod deintegrate && pod install
   ```

3. **Android Build Issues**
   ```bash
   cd android && ./gradlew clean
   ```

4. **Permission Issues**
   - Ensure camera permissions are granted
   - Check Info.plist and AndroidManifest.xml configurations

### Getting Help

- Check the React Native documentation
- Review platform-specific setup guides
- Ensure all dependencies are properly linked
- Verify environment variables and API keys
